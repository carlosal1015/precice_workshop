# An interface to preCICEÂ in pyiron workflows
The workflow here uses `pyiron_continuum` to create two fenics jobs, which each solves heat conduction equations. Additionally, the job have a adapter_conf object, which defines the coupling between defined jobs using `fenics-precice` adapter. 
The configuration accepts the required json file, but additionally it can prescribe the coupling expression or coupling_data based on the type of boundary condition at the coupling boundary.   

After declaring the fenics jobs, a precice job is defined. Then the two fenics jobs are added to the newly created job. By running the precice job, the two child jobs run in parallel.
